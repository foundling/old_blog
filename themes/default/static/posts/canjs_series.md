I started using CanJS while I was working on a real-time shipping application at a logistics company in Seattle. CanJS was the bedrock for their real-time dashboard application as it offers a variety of observable data structures as well as computed properties, so you can update your UI based on a dynamic data collection. And it turns out that they aren't the only ones using it, the Apple Store is, too! All in all, CanJS is a very capable and progressive framework. However, it doesn't have the market/mindshare of Angular, React or Ember, and I think I know why. Bitovi, the open-source consulting company that created and maintains CanJS, has generated a great community of developers around the framework, which means that you can get quick and useful answers to common issues if you use the available channels (that is, if you know what the available channels are. See below).  And herein lies the problem that I see: when you use CanJS, you can totally feel its benefit, but you soon start running into issues ranging from the simplest of things like forgetting to call 'new' to complex things like figuring out how to truly build a component-first application, where the error messages don't really help you that much. That alone isn't a total deal-breaker. But turning to the CanJS documentation, you'll find that the idiomatic advice extends barely beyond simple examples, and the documentation looks somewhat programmatic rather than human generated (in fact, Bitovi uses the same automated documentation scheme and representation for each of the tools that they build). The point of all of this is to say (to all framework authors): your documentation is the sole of your framework, and things that seem obvious actually need to be spelled out!  I am not a new developer, so if I'm getting stuck on something trivial often, that's definitely a problem. As you scale your application, you really need to be able to trust the fact that easy things will remain easy and hard things will be possible.

## But Wait, Why CanJS?

I bet you're still wondering: why the funk am I writing a tutorial series on a framework that I find so frustrating? For a few reasons: 

- it's a nice framework 

- it's not going anywhere

- it's always improving, and 

- to salvage a lot of the time I spent figuring things out by sharing that knowledge with you, dear citizen of the internet. 

If you write apps with CanJS, these posts might come in handy.  Beyond Bitovi, an internet search will just yield 'top 7 JavaScript framework comparison' posts with little of concrete value to help you build stuff. That's where I come in.

## So What are the Channels?
Ordered roughly from 'start here' to 'increase your knowledge here', here they are:

+ The [Guides](https://canjs.com/guides/index.html)
+ The [API Documentation](https://canjs.com/docs/index.html)
+ Bitovi's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_HPFLeKzJNLOUnLc_3311Q/videos)
+ The [Forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs) 
+ The CanJS Issues page on GitHub[GitHub page](https://github.com/canjs/canjs/issues)
