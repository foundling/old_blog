<h1>Forward</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Alex Ramsdell, a web developer living in Seattle, Washington, and this is my forward.</p>

<p>Why does this website exist?  Well, I didn’t grow up with the knowledge that someone actually made software. So finding that out has been pretty interesting.  This notion came to me in my twenties when I started programming for an unknown reason.  This website exists as a frustrating and rewarding space for me to jam out about a small, small subset of things that strike me as truly amazing about software construction and principles. It is also a place for me to build the platform for jamming out about software, which I believe is called reinventing the wheel, so expect changes.  Big, technical, monolithic, legally delayed for years yet ultimately pardonable(?)  changes to this site, all wrought by just me!</p>
