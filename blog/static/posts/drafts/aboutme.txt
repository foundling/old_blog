# Forward

Hi, I’m Alex Ramsdell, a web developer living in Seattle, and this is my forward.

Why does this website exist, you ask?  Well, it didn’t occur to me when I was younger that so many things were powered by software.  So finding that out has been pretty interesting.  In my mid twenties I started programming for an unknown reason.  This website exists as an historically frustrating and rewarding space for me to jam out about a small, small subset of amazing things about software and its construction. And also to separately jam out about design and UI. And a place to assemble the actual platform for jamming out about software and UI, which I believe is called reinventing the wheel.  Reinventing the wheel is pretty fun so expect changes.  Big, technical, monolithic, legally delayed for years and ultimately pardonable  changes to this site, all wrought by just me!

# The Stack

The blog part of this site runs with the help of the following tools: MongoDB, Python, Flask, PyMongo, Frozen-Flask, HTML, CSS, SASS, Nginx and <webhost>.

# The Guides

Additionally, I have some short guides to Python,  JavaScript and Linux in the works that will probably be implemented as web text-books in Angular. The approach in these books is humbly informed by my single year as a community programming instructor in Massachusetts.  I hope that someone might find one of these guides when they need it like I found the GNU C tutorial and pointers were then clarified.  I love helping new programmers develop their problem-solving skills and overall programming confidence. The guides aim to be a conversational but sneakily theoretical approach to that end.
