Introduction

Welcome to my Python guide. It focuses on Python 2.7.8 because that is what I work with daily and know the best.

My method here is generally to introduce topics in such a way as to require you to do a little bit of thinking before I fully explain them. My hope is that you'll *start* as a critical programmer rather than as a flailing programmer who later on needs to learn good habits. Always try to find an answer the questions you have.
