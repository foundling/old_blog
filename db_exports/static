[{"_id":{"$oid":"56394156848c4d6c35ff637c"},"author":"alex","content":"# The Forward\n\nHi. I’m Alex Ramsdell, a JavaScripter and Python fanatic living in Seattle, Washington. This site exists as a place to articulate my interests in:\n\n  + software and web development\n  + Linux\n  + philosophy\n  + other interesting things\n  + fun stuff, like my [musical projects](http://www.alexramsdell.com/fun/music), [photos of iceland](http://www.alexramsdell.com/fun/photos/iceland) and [programming guides](http://www.alexramsdell.com/guides).\n  + graphic design\n\n'Rolling your own blogging platform' is considered an exercise in reinventing the wheel by about half the programmers in the world, so I dedicate this to those people. Expect big, monolithic, Enterprise-level changes that will take years of committee meetings just to approve!\n\n# The Stack\n\nThe blog part of this site runs with the help of the following tools: Python, MongoDB, PyMongo, Flask, HTML, CSS, Sass, Nginx, gunicorn, CentOS and DigitalOcean. The programming guides are ... *will be* ... written in Angular in a text-book-y fashion. \n\n# The Guides\n\nThese are in the works, due in some time in the form of web text-books, in Angular probably. The teaching in these books is humbly informed by my experience as a Linux sysadmin and a community programming instructor in Massachusetts. My students there taught me a great deal about the flexibility and communication skills necessary to help someone learn something in depth.  I hope that someone might find one of these guides when they need it, as I found the GNU C tutorial and pointers were then clarified.\n\n# The Musical Stuff  \n\nI'm a musician and amateur recording nut.  You can find some of the music I've done [here](http://www.alexramsdell.com/fun/music). My tastes seem to vary wildly over time, but in the last few years I've learned that if there is one thing that motivates me musically, it's rhythm, so I'm currently interested in exploring that as well as areas like music for film, tv and independent video games.\n\nSome of my favorite things to listen to are: [Aphex Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk), 70s New York salsa, aka salsa dura (specifically, I'm thinking of [Hector Lavoe and Willie Colón](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT77krRcVIA)), early Detroit techno ([Cybotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqiBFqWCTU), [Model 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E2eg3URv6M\u0026index=5\u0026list=RDKNz01ty-kTQ)), 70s psych/prog (you can't really beat [In the Court of the Crimson King](https://vimeo.com/135162705), in my opinion), as well as the music that came out of England between 1979 and the 1981, which we generally call postpunk, the first wave, the good one ([The Chameleons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocBR2TIX378), [Young Marble Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbi_wnEbnGs), [The Raincoats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2EDHYk50S0\u0026list=PLnsD_k85qid7ULfDWh-hkMg9TwJqMiik7),[Robyn Hitchcock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ0rQ7t9efk\u0026list=PLC2DA3D9B24B49B06), [Joy Division](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBYQO-0ttQc), [The Homosexuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw2akAeSkm0)). \n\nIf you are interested in making some music with me, give me a shout on Twitter [@drlolzrofl](https://twitter.com/drlolzrofl).\n\n\n# Design\n\nJust one influence to mention here: H.N. Werkman. He was a very passionate and lonely Dutch printmaker who never really found the proper artistic community nor financial success and was eventually killed by the Nazis. He did amazing, groundbreaking things with type, and is permanent member of my hall of fame. There isn't too much written about him in English, but the book [H.N Werkman](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300102901) by Alston W. Purvis is a great, accessible introduction and basic history of his artistic life.\n\n# The Bookshelf\n\nThese are the books I read over and over again:\n\n+ [Independent People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_People) by Halldor Laxness\n+ [Discipline and Punish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) by Michel Foucault\n+ [Sunlight Dialogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunlight_Dialogues) by John Gardner\n+ [A Girl With a Monkey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50699.A_Girl_with_a_Monkey) by Leonard Michaels\n+ [The City in History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_in_History) by Louis Mumford\n+ [Word and Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_and_Object) by Willard Van Orman Quite\n+ [An Introduction to Symbolic Logic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/287529.An_Introduction_to_Symbolic_Logic) by Suzanne K. Langer\n+ [Thinking Machines](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/irving-adler-3/thinking-machines/) by Irving Adler\n+ [Naming and Necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_and_Necessity) by Saul Kripke\n","date":{"$date":"2015-11-03T15:20:54.015Z"},"title":"About Me"}]
