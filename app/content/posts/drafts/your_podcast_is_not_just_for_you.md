# Note To Podcasters: Your Podcast is Not Just For You

I'm not just a podcast junkie. Worse, I'm a *software* podcast junkie.  The following are podcasts that I listen to on the regular:

Software Engineering Radio
Software Engineering Daily
Programming Throwdown
From Python import Podcast
Talk Python To Me
JavaScript Jabber
Developer Happy Hour
The Web Forward
Away from the Keyboard
The Retrobits Podcast
Hanselminutes
Full Stack Radio
The StackOverflow Podcast (also, for a while called the Stack Exchange Podcast)
The Bike Shed
NodeUp
Test and Code
Functional Geekery
Greater than Code
Hacker Public Radio
Three Unicorns
Code Newbie
...

Last week, with excitement, I became aware of the fact that Kenneth Reitz and Alex Gaynor, notable members of the Python community, have a podcast called Import This: a Podcast for Humans. I'm writing this post to express my disappointment at what I heard. I'm going to *try* not to extrapolate my complaints about the podcast to tech industry's lack of intellectual and ethical grit as a system. And not because I feel that I'd be aimlessly complaining about anecdotal evidence but because I'd then need to go and install an endless scrolling plugin to this site just to get the content to reasonably fit into readable hyper-space. One must not try to go summing infinite lists of numbers.

The opening moments of the podcast's first episode serve as a mission statement: 

QUOTE [EPISODE: TIME]
'theres not enough meat'

I'm with Kenneth on this one. There are not enough discussion-based podcasts about programming. Most podcasts tend to take the interview-a-new-guest-each-week tack. While I do enjoy the interview-based format, it often leads to qualifications like 'Well, we cant get too in depth here because its a podcast', or 'we cant talk about the actual code because its a podcast'.  I am on the other extreme: READ ME YOUR CODE ON THE PODCAST.  I CAN TAKE IT. BTW, I AM CURRENTLY GOING FOR A WALK. 

The ensuing discussion started off well, focusing on the historical disparity 18th century and current attitudes regarding technological progress, hopes, limitations. We complain about mobile-phone related annoyances today, while these annoyances profoundly eclipse the universe of possibility that a given 18th century innvator could fathom.

[Quote][ep:time]

I appreciated the irony. But they then slide into a discussion about reading books, which neither of them admittedly do any more -- Yes: wait, a couple of guys who don't read books are telling me about the history of the modern world. wat.

[Quote][ep:time]
    - reading a book means you're getting the information too slowly.

## Books, They're Not a Waste of Time

This begs the question: what did either of them read or watch recently that led to this discussion? I have a sneaking suspicion that the link-posting cultures of Reddit and HackerNews have something to do with this. I spend a fair amount of time in these spaces myself. They are quite amazing sources for discovery and at the same time they are free-for-all, context-obscured platforms for information dissemination by anyone for anyone. To mistake frequent reading of these sites for the development of a substantive consciousness of history is a mistake in my opinion. You don't get credit for merely having a vague interest in history as a software developer. The profession is explicitly a drivers of technological change. It should be your duty to take an interest. It's called being ethical.

As it stands, physical books are still by far the best way to absorb a sustained thesis about anything in a relatively uncoercive and distraction-free medium. The point can be made in depth without hyperlinking every other word in teh text, no subtle SEO-plagued language, no comment thread, no threat of push notifications letting you know that Bob commented on Alice's Twitter post. And the source material is stated and treated seriously. The question this begs is, what are you hoping to get when you watch that documentary on YouTube or spend 10 minutes reading that HackerNews article about the Industrial Revolution's effect on X. Are you trying to learn something, or are you trying to feel as though you're learning something as a mental break in between the code you're writing.

I literally force myself to read books because it benefits my ability to think, speak and maintain empathy for others in a way that nothing else does. I do it despite the the strong current of cultural forces, and more specifically the industry forces, heading the other way. The only thing that keeps me human is reflection.

## People Writing Business Logic are Not True Coders ?

And then comes the discussion of AI.  The thought offered is that companies like Google, who are investing in code generation powered by machine-learning and AI, will put most programmers out of a job. But that's okay for Kenneth and Alex because:

[Quote][ep: time]
    - those are just business-logic developers. The are uninspired laborers (proletariat ?). WE on the other hand do something that's actually important. 

A propos of the Industrial Revolution, there were large underclasses who bore the weight of these technical achievements while white men received the compensation and credit. I'm not sure either of these guys have read much recent literature on the sociology of the Industrial Revolution or the Enlightenment. It has a tremendous dark side.  I'd be remiss if I don't mention the entire corpus of Michel Foucault's writing as an amazing, if not somewhat idiosyncratic, testament to this.


There is an additional moment that struck me as also very unreflective. Kenneth mentions that of all the developers he's worked with, the ones he's gotten along best with have been coding since they were young. If you listen to any other podcast, especially interview podcasts, you inevitably will come across a guess who explains his/her back story as a departrue from the standard 


[
Don't forget the mention that the 'good' developers these guys work with have been coding since they were kids. There's just an unspoken understanding there.

If this isn't elitist then I'm not sure what is. Open source has never *not* been problematic, but this sort of attitude makes me angry. Jon Skeet, top StackOverflow user of all time, considers himself to be a plumber of sorts. [link] So what makes you so special that you think such software automation wouldn't displace you? Are you in the top n% of developers? If not, then wouldn't you be displaced as well?

## Coding Since You Were a Kid 

The sense I get at this point is: 

    - entitled, but hard working, male software engineers 
    - get to tell us how modern history works
    - even though they don't read books, which are an ineffectively use of acquiring knowledge 
    - and 
    - go unchallenged enough by their peers because
    - 
    - cherry picking history highlights from an entirely etherial and unaccountable knowledge repositories to make a point that is ... ?


## Podcasts Today

As a self-taught developer who codes implusively, all the time, and who cares about both the sociological and technical state of the industry, software podcasts have partially been a way for me to find a way out of being treated like merely a cog at the whim of a byzantine mangement hierarchy. But I've always had an uneasiness as well which stems from the fact that much of these podcasts speak of a world that so sharply differs from mine, a world where diversity is important. But in listening to this podcast, I think these guys have unintentionally revealed the darker truths that these other podcasts are uninterested in talking about. Today, in web development, you have to work frankly *too* hard without respite in order to get to a place where you aren't burning yourself out. If you have a degree that certainly helps, but more and more people don't have a degree, and so are forced to construct the boat while sailing it.

## Conclusion 

None of the attitudes that I take issue with above are exclusive to the hosts of Import This. They are commonplace attitudes in open source. I see evidence of this every day in other podcasts, developer blogs, tech conferences and job ads. The exception that I take with this podcast is that it draws a rather ungracious and elitist distinction between the people involved in the podcast itself and the potential listenership. The thought that they could be essentially writing off legions of business-logic-writing as inconsequential (in the eyes of the technological future, which they know so much about) reflects a darker side of open-source 'inclusivity'. Once you escape business-logic, you don't look back. And at that point, you not only know a lot about software development. You know a lot about everything, because you have mastered the generalized art of learning.

I seriously disagree.

In fact, the environment that you've learned to hack is so full of hype, so biased by corporate interests, that your ability to think critically and to *act* extends only so far as your financial and career interests aren't threatened.

If you want to be a real 'human' ( as Kenneth is so eager to phrase it), and not just a developer, you could do the industry a favor and promote values like literacy, critical thinking and inclusiveness. I think even if you just pick any one of these and pursue it seriously, you will hit all three. And not just by re-tweeting the efforts of others who re-tweet others who *talk* about these things.

If you're going to publish a podcast, you need to acknowledge the fact that it's not just for you and your inner circle of open source. with this stortYour podcast is not just for you for developers
