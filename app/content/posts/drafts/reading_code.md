I don't usually get the feeling that being well-read (in programming) is of much value practically in the industry. Maybe if SICP is a known term at your workplace, then we should talk. But this has never been a household term in my previous workplaces.  People knew more o wizards and magic at those places of work.  There was no SICP passion. Which is a shame to me. I understand this when taken alone.  If you're just well read, well, sorry, no thanks. But if you a programmer who is truly well-read in programming, you are of ultimate value. If you truly want to get things done and know of computing history, you really are a 10X dev.
